--- Use R to run t procedures to conduct inference on two population means

t.test() requires both x and y
t.test(standard, intensive, alternative="two.sided",  mu=0)

--- User R to run large sample (approximate Z) procedures to conduct inference on two proportions 

Large sample procedures for p1-p2
# Large sample Z test and confidence interval for p1-p2 in R
prop.test
prop.test(c(96,128), c(252,258))

The independent two sample t-test and confidence interval are parametric methods appropriate for examining the difference in means for two populations. They can aslo be thought of as a way of examining the relationship between a numeric outcome or Y variable and a categorical explanatory or X variable.
