Follow-up Analyses
Two sample t-tests for pairwise comparisons:
pairwise.t.test()
Tukey's HSD tests and confidence intervals:
TukeyHSD()
Generates P values and confidence inteverals for all possible pairwise populations when combining means of more than two populations. 

==========================

One Way Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA is a parametric method appropriate for comparing the Means for 2 or more independent populations

We will expore the relateionship ??? Weight Loss crop Group. 

We can conduct an analysis of variance using the "aov" command/function in R

Conducting the Paired t-test and Confidence Interval using R

The paired t-test and confidence interval in statistics are parametric methods appropriate for examining the difference in means for two populations that are paired or dependent on one another
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analyzing relationship between one X variable (Categorical/Factor), with independent group, and its effect on a Y variable(Numeric)

Assumptions to wok with ANOVA:
- SRS (Simple Random Sample), Independent observations
- Independent groups
- Roughly the same SD (standard deviations) of each group
- Each group has large sample sizes (>20) or Groups are approximately normal
